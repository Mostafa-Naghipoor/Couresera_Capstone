It does NOT, however, show the official territorial boundary of the city concerning other administrative regions in the east, west, and south of Jakarta.\nHowever, because the author is from Indonesia, we know roughly which neighborhood belongs to Jakarta and which does not. In this scenario, we want to propose a strategic locations (i.e. neighborhood) for the investing group within the Jakarta governmental area.\nResults\nThe chart below show the population density in Jakarta.\nimport matplotlib as plt\n\ndf_population.set_index('City')['Total population 2020(people/km\u00b2)'].plot.bar()\n\nThe chart below show the population density in Jakarta, per district\nimport matplotlib as plt\n\ndf_most_population.set_index('district')['Total population 2020 (people/km\u00b2)'].plot.bar()\n\nBased on the graph results shown that areas need the distribution of masks the most is Central Jakarta (Jakarta Pusat) with the most populated areas. Then 5 districts that mostly need for a distribution of masks are Kali Anyar, Kampung Rawa, Galur, Tanah Tinggi, and Kerendang.\nTo better understand and estimate the territories or areas that are within the administrative government of Jakarta city, we need to plot all the districts that we have downloaded from the riwayat-file-covid-19-dki-jakarta-jakartagis.hub.arcgis.com site together with their latitude and longitude values. The following lines of Python code will execute the task using Folium API.\n# Construct a map of all districts neighborhood in Jakarta \nmap_jkt = folium.Map(location=[-6.2, 106.8], zoom_start=11)\nfor lat, lng, label in zip(df_cases['Latitude'], df_cases['Longitude'], df_cases['DISTRICT']):\n    label = folium.Popup(label, parse_html=True)\n    folium.CircleMarker(\n        location=[lat, lng],\n        radius=5,\n        popup=label,\n        color='blue',\n        fill=True,\n        fill_color='#3186cc',\n        fill_opacity=0.7,\n        parse_html=False).add_to(map_jkt)      \nmap_jkt\n\nAs we can see from the above map, most of the districts are within the main outer ring roads surrounding the city, and others are situated outside the main ring roads. To solve in our business challenge, we need to show the extent and the distribution medical devices for treatment of COVID-19 positive case-patients within the city of Jakarta based on the number that we obtained from the government site. The following lines of Python code will achieve the task and present the data in a clear visual approach.\n# Plot a map of Covid-19 distribution in the city of Jakarta per May 28, 2020\nmap_covid_jkt = folium.Map(location=[-6.2, 106.8], zoom_start=11)\nfor lat,lon,area,size in zip(df_cases['Latitude'],df_cases['Longitude'],df_cases['DISTRICT'],df_cases['POSITIVE']):\n     folium.CircleMarker(\n         location=[lat, lon],\n         popup=area,\n         radius=size/2,\n         color='r',\n         opacity=0.5,\n         fill=True,\n         fill_opacity=0.5,\n         fill_color='red',\n         ).add_to(map_covid_jkt)\nmap_covid_jkt\n\nThis is a similar map plot that we can see from the government task force for Covid-19 cases in Jakarta. Their graph can be seen in this link: https://corona.jakarta.go.id/id/peta-persebaran. As we can see, most of the regions in Jakarta are now in the \u2018RED\u2019 zone, with the radius of the circle represent the relative extent of Covid-19 distribution in the City of Jakarta.\nA better presentation of the data would be to use a \u2018slider\u2019 in the map that shows the growth of the circle day by day or simply an animation that shows the daily growth of Covid-19 cases in the city. An app developer might develop an App that alerts vehicles/road users that alerts that they are not allowed to pass the RED zone within the city. This App could save lives! The next set of problems that we need to solve is to show the location of existing and approved Covid-19 testing centers (or reference hospitals) and see how well they are distributed to each other within the city and in which regions of Jakarta. The following lines of Python code show how. We will first try to plot the hospitals WITHOUT the RED circles as that might cause distraction.\n# Construct a map of all existing Covid-19 testing hospitals in Jakarta \nmap_hosp = folium.Map(location=[-6.2, 106.8], zoom_start=12)\nfor lat, lng, hosp in zip(df_hospital['Latitude'], df_hospital['Longitude'], df_hospital['Hospital']):\n    label = folium.Popup(hosp, parse_html=True)\n    folium.Marker(\n        location=[lat, lng],\n        popup=hosp,\n        icon=folium.Icon(color='blue', icon='header'),\n        ).add_to(map_hosp)      \nmap_hosp\n\nAs you can see, the hospitals are quite sparsely distributed within each other except the two hospitals in the south are relatively close to each other (i.e. Fatmawati and Pasar Minggu hospitals). Let\u2019s see how strategic they are in accomodating the extent of positive cases patients in the city. We can do this by overlaying the two data within a single map as shown in the following codes:\n# Plot a combined map of Covid-19 distribution in the city of Jakarta & current available testing centers\nmap_covid_hosp_jkt = folium.Map(location=[-6.2, 106.8], zoom_start=11)\nfor lat,lon,area,size in zip(df_cases['Latitude'],df_cases['Longitude'],df_cases['DISTRICT'],df_cases['POSITIVE']):\n     folium.CircleMarker(\n         location=[lat, lon],\n         popup=area,\n         radius=size/2,\n         color='r',\n         opacity=0.5,\n         fill=True,\n         fill_opacity=0.5,\n         fill_color='red',\n         ).add_to(map_covid_hosp_jkt)\n# Construct a map of all existing Covid-19 testing hospitals in Jakarta \nfor lat, lng, hosp in zip(df_hospital['Latitude'], df_hospital['Longitude'], df_hospital['Hospital']):\n    label = folium.Popup(hosp, parse_html=True)\n    folium.Marker(\n        location=[lat, lng],\n        popup=hosp,\n        icon=folium.Icon(color='blue', icon='header'),\n        ).add_to(map_covid_hosp_jkt)      \nmap_covid_hosp_jkt\n\nWe can see from the results of the distribution of COVID-19 cases and the location of hospitals, almost all hospitals require a lot of medical equipment for COVID-19 treatment. In addition to Fatmawati hospital and the Pasar Minggu hospital, the distribution of the COVID-19 case is not as extensive as other hospitals.\nDiscussion\nWe will try to analyze locations in the red zone based on the location of the hospital in the middle of the red zone. We determine based on the location of the Tarakan Hospital, Central Jakarta.\nLet\u2019s begin by trying to get the top 100 venues that are within Tarakan Hospital neighborhood and are within a radius of 500 meters of our candidate Covid-19 testing center using FOURSQUARE API. First, let\u2019s create the GET request URL. Name that URL, url.\nprop_neighborhood = pd.DataFrame({\n   'Hospital':['RSUD Tarakan']\n})\nneighborhood_latitude_list = []   # create empty lists for latitude\nneighborhood_longitude_list = []  # create empty lists for longitude\nfor index, row in prop_neighborhood.iterrows(): # iterate over rows in dataframe\n    neigh = row['Hospital']  \n    query = str(neigh) + ', Jakarta Pusat'\n    results = geocoder.geocode(query)   \n    lat = results[0]['geometry']['lat']\n    long = results[0]['geometry']['lng']\n    neighborhood_latitude_list.append(lat)\n    neighborhood_longitude_list.append(long)\n# create new columns from lists    \nprop_neighborhood['Latitude'] = neighborhood_latitude_list   \nprop_neighborhood['Longitude'] = neighborhood_longitude_list\nprop_neighborhood\n\n# Define function that extracts the category of the venue based on the returned JSON file\ndef get_category_type(row):\n    try:\n        categories_list = row['categories']\n    except:\n        categories_list = row['venue.categories']\n        \n    if len(categories_list) == 0:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return categories_list[0]['name']\nneighborhood_latitude = 0\nneighborhood_longitude = 0\naddress = 'RSUD Tarakan, Jakarta Pusat'\ngeolocator = Nominatim(user_agent=\"Hospital_agent\")\nlocation = geolocator.geocode(address)\nneighborhood_latitude= location.latitude\nneighborhood_longitude= location.longitude\nprint(\"RSUD Tarakan: \", neighborhood_latitude, \",\",neighborhood_longitude)\nOutput:\nRSUD Tarakan:  -6.17163765 , 106.81034620548138\nGet URL for the API in Tarakan Hospital neighborhood.\nLIMIT = 100 # limit of number of venues returned by Foursquare API\nradius = 500 # define radius in meter\n# create URL\nurl = \u2018https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?&client_id={}&client_secret={}&v={}&ll={},{}&radius={}&limit={}'.format(\n CLIENT_ID, \n CLIENT_SECRET, \n VERSION, \n neighborhood_latitude, \n neighborhood_longitude, \n radius, \n LIMIT)\n# url \u2014 not printed for privacy\nNext, let\u2019s make a request using REQUEST library, and name our query results for Tarakan Hospital area, results.\n# Send the GET request and examine the resutls\nresults = requests.get(url).json()\n# results - not printed for shortening of the report\nNext, we will use the above function (get_category_type) to extract information from the JSON file related to venues in the Tarakan Hospital neighborhood. The following line of code should do the trick:\nvenues = results['response']['groups'][0]['items']\n    \nnearby_venues = json_normalize(venues) # flatten JSON\n# filter columns\nfiltered_columns = ['venue.name', 'venue.categories', 'venue.location.lat', 'venue.location.lng']\nnearby_venues =nearby_venues.loc[:, filtered_columns]\n# filter the category for each row\nnearby_venues['venue.categories'] = nearby_venues.apply(get_category_type, axis=1)\n# clean columns\nnearby_venues.columns = [col.split(\".\")[-1] for col in nearby_venues.columns]\nnearby_venues\n\n# Check how many venues were returned by Foursquare?\nprint('{} venues were returned by Foursquare for {} neighborhood.'.format(nearby_venues.shape[0], prop_neighborhood.iloc[0,0]))\nOutput:\n28 venues were returned by Foursquare for RSUD Tarakan neighborhood.",
